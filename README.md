The Venus Project Text Based Visit

This project is beeing developed by Futuragora wich is a Portuguese NPO for the resource based economy. We founded it in 2009 and since then have been developing many experimental projects in diversed areas. Since our foundation we tested some ways of materializing virtualy the proposals and goal of The Venus Project and the Resource Based Economy. Some years ago we came with the idea of developing a text-based TVP experience as the CGI virtualization would be impossible to attain with our limited resources. The project stayed on the board until we decided to advance recently for a final and public version of this project.

The project is designed to have three stages of development:

Stage 1 - Circular city maping and navigation: This stage will be developed as we get close to version 0.1.0 when it will be published and available to anyone to use. We will make a text based expirience on visiting the first "virtual" tvp city.

Stage 2 - Points, Inventory, Research: Second stage will be final at 0.2.1 and will envolve a point system for research or colaboration purposed. There will be a personal invetory on the experience. And funcional virutal TVP research center connected to existing TVP suport platforms.

Stage 3 - Chat Bot and search engine: On third stage will will incorporate a simple chatbot focused on helping visitors and reseachers. The chatbot project was tested a couple of year agora and will need a interaction with the askjacquefresco website, the aiml conversation files and wikipedia automated search interface.
